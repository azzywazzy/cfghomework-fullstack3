Login App

This project creates a simple login app that uses conditional routing and state to send users to the right page.

It:
- Takes username and password inputs from the user
    - ![image](/login-logout-app/images/login%20page.png)
    - ![image](/login-logout-app/images/login%20page%20with%20data.png)
- If the right username and password are entered, it takes you to a Login Successful page
    - ![image](/login-logout-app/images//login%20successful.png)
- If the details entered are incorrect, it takes you to a Login Unsuccessul page
    - ![image](/login-logout-app/images//login%20unsuccessful.png)
- Both pages give you the option to return to the Login page to begin again
- Please note that the password field hides the data being typed in by the user
